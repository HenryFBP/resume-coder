    - Managed a game-web server GUI using said databases.
    - Managed small databases and player requests/server administration.
    - Wrote HTML, CSS and PHP with MySQL for pages.

Arduino Soil Tester Project:

    start: 2013

  desc: Soil sensor built by simple circuitry and coding in an arduino. Resistance measurements of soil by recording
  averages of AC current through two electrodes were how the moisture levels in the soil were determined.

Mathematica Compression Project:
  date: June 2015
  desc: Over the summer, I enrolled in an IIT Mathematica course where I coded an ASCII compression algorithm that took
  256 of the most common duplets of characters in an ASCII file and compressed them into a file containing a dictionary
  followed by compressed data.

Portable Desktop in a Suitcase:
  date: 2015
  desc: This is a project that involved building a portable desktop in a suitcase my freshman semester.
  list:
    - Three rectangular holes were cut in an aluminum briefcase, one in the lower-left and the other two in the
    top-middle and top-right.
    - All components were put on multiple custom-designed laser-cut slabs of plastic and screwed onto various locations
    on the plastic plates.
    - The power supply was flipped upside-down and placed in the lower-left section of the case, and bolted there.
    - The graphics card was rotated 90 degrees to the left and three custom mounting plates were constructed for it.
    The first two plates sat at the top and bottom of the card, and held it over the motherboard. The third was to fill
    space so that the screws on the bottom did not press into the card.
    - The PCIE-16x cable for the graphics card had to be connected to an extension cable, similar to one for a bitcoin
    mining rig.
    - A power supply cable for a screen driver for an LCD panel was soldered to the GROUND and 5V leads of a molex
    connector attached to the power supply, making the power for the screen self-contained.
    - A USB header → USB port → wifi dongle supplies wireless, and there is a free-hanging SSD for boot and other
    files.
